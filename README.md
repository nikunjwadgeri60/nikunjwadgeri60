#### <div align="center">Hi, I'm Nikunj Wadgeri. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology (Class of 2025), with a deep focus on Machine Learning and Data Analytics.</div>  
  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing and deploying machine learning models, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), and exploring advanced data analytics solutions using Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift  
  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs), optimize machine learning models using techniques like hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods, and explore advanced Data Analytics tools like Google BigQuery, Databricks, and AWS Redshift for big data processing.  
  

- ❓ Ask me about anything related to Machine Learning algorithms, model building, or how I’m probably overfitting my weekend plans with too many data projects!  
  

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge fan of both coding and data visualization, and I believe a good chart is as powerful as a thousand words!
